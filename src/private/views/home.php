      Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington, on July 5, 1994. Initially an online 
      marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the 
      moniker The Everything Store. It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox 
      (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other 
      subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for 
      US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.
